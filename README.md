📘 React Counter App🔢 – Project Description
This project is a React-based Counter App that allows users to increment, decrement, and reset a numerical counter. Along with displaying the current count, the app also dynamically indicates whether the number is even or odd, and whether it is a prime number.

🔧 Features:
Counter Display:

-> Shows the current value of the counter on the screen.

➕+1 Button:

-> Increases the counter value by 1 each time it's clicked.

➖−1 Button:

-> Decreases the counter value by 1 each time it's clicked.

🔁Reset Button:

-> Resets the counter value back to 0.

Even or Odd Indicator:

->Automatically determines and displays whether the current count is even or odd.

Prime Number Indicator:

->Checks and displays whether the current count is a prime number.

🧠 Why It's Cool:
This app teaches you number concepts while interacting with React state in real time. Great for:

React beginners 👩‍💻👨‍💻

Learning conditional rendering 🧩

Practicing hooks (useState) and functions 🛠️

🧠 Logic Overview:
State Management: Uses React’s useState to manage the count value.

--> Increment / Decrement: Updates the counter with setCount() by increasing or decreasing the value.

--> Reset: Sets the counter back to zero.

--> Even/Odd Check: Uses count % 2 === 0 to determine if the number is even.

--> Prime Check: Uses a simple function to check if the current number is prime.

💡 Learning Objectives:
~ Learn how to manage state in React using hooks (useState)

~ Understand how to handle user interactions (button clicks)

~ Practice writing custom logic to determine number properties (even, odd, prime)

~ Implement conditional rendering in React
